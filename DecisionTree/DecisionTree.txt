A decision tree is a popular machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It models decisions and their possible consequences as a tree-like structure, where:
- Nodes represent features or attributes.
- Branches represent decision rules based on those features.
- Leaves represent the final outcomes or class labels.

Advantages:
- Easy to Understand: Decision trees are intuitive and easy to visualize.
- Non-Linear Relationships: They can model complex non-linear relationships.
- No Need for Feature Scaling: Unlike some algorithms, decision trees do not require normalization of features.

Disadvantages:
- Overfitting: Decision trees can become overly complex and fit the noise in the data.
- Instability: Small changes in the data can lead to a completely different tree structure.
- Bias: They can be biased towards features with more levels or categories.
