Logistic regression is a statistical and machine learning technique used for classification tasks. 
It predicts the probability of an outcome based on one or more predictor variables.

Advantages:
- Probabilistic Interpretation: Provides probabilities for the binary outcome, which can be useful for understanding the uncertainty in predictions.
- Efficiency: Computationally efficient and works well with large datasets.
- Simplicity: Easy to implement and interpret, making it suitable for various applications.

Disadvantages:
- Linearity Assumption: Assumes a linear relationship between the independent variables and the log-odds of the dependent variable.
- Binary Outcomes: Primarily suited for binary classification; extensions exist for multi-class problems (e.g., multinomial logistic regression).
- Not Suitable for Complex Relationships: May not capture non-linear relationships or interactions between features without additional techniques.
