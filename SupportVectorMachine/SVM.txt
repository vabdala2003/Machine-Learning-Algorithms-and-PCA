Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a powerful supervised learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. 
It is particularly effective in high-dimensional spaces and for problems where the number of dimensions exceeds the number of samples.

Key Concepts:
- Hyperplane: SVM aims to find the best decision boundary (hyperplane) that separates data points of different classes in a feature space.
- Support Vectors: These are the data points that are closest to the hyperplane and influence its position and orientation. 
They are critical in defining the optimal hyperplane.
- Margin: The distance between the hyperplane and the nearest data point of each class is called the margin. 
SVM seeks to maximize this margin, leading to better generalization on unseen data.

Kernel Functions:
- Linear Kernel: Suitable for linearly separable data.
- Polynomial Kernel: Allows for curved decision boundaries by considering polynomial combinations of features.
- Radial Basis Function (RBF) Kernel: Also known as the Gaussian kernel, it is used to create complex decision boundaries and works well for most problems.
- Sigmoid Kernel: Similar to neural networks, used in specific cases.

Advantages:
- Effective in High Dimensions: SVM is particularly useful when the number of features is greater than the number of samples.
- Robust to Overfitting: Especially in high-dimensional space, SVM tends to be less prone to overfitting compared to other classifiers.
- Versatile: Through the use of different kernel functions, SVM can handle both linear and non-linear classification.

Disadvantages:
- Computational Complexity: Training an SVM can be slow and memory-intensive, especially with large datasets.
- Choice of Kernel: Selecting the appropriate kernel and tuning hyperparameters (like C and gamma) can be challenging.
- No Probabilistic Outputs: SVM does not inherently provide probabilities for predictions, though methods like Platt scaling can be used to estimate them.
