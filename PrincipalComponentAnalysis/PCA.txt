Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a widely used statistical technique for dimensionality reduction, feature extraction, and data visualization. 
It transforms a dataset with potentially correlated features into a set of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components.

Key Concepts:
- Dimensionality Reduction: PCA reduces the number of features in a dataset while preserving as much variance as possible. This is useful for simplifying models, 
reducing computational costs, and mitigating the curse of dimensionality.
- Principal Components: These are new variables created as linear combinations of the original features. They are orthogonal to each other and ranked by the amount of variance they capture from the data.

Advantages:
- Data Compression: Reduces the size of the dataset while preserving essential information.
- Noise Reduction: Helps eliminate noise and redundant features.
- Improved Visualization: Facilitates visualization of high-dimensional data in 2D or 3D plots.

Disadvantages:
- Interpretability: Principal components are linear combinations of original features and may not have clear, interpretable meanings.
- Variance Focus: PCA emphasizes variance, which may not always align with the most relevant features for specific tasks.

Applications:
- Data Preprocessing: Used before applying machine learning algorithms to improve performance.
- Image Compression: Reduces the dimensionality of image data for storage and transmission.
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Identifies patterns and relationships in high-dimensional datasets.
