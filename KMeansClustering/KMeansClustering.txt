K-means clustering is a widely used unsupervised machine learning algorithm that partitions a dataset into distinct clusters based on feature similarity. 
The goal is to group similar data points together and find patterns within the data.

Key Concepts:
- Clusters: Groups of data points that share similar characteristics.
- Centroids: The central point of a cluster, which is the mean of all points in that cluster.
- Iteration: The algorithm involves iterative steps:
    - Initialization: Randomly select K initial centroids.
    - Assignment: Assign each data point to the nearest centroid, forming K clusters.
    - Update: Recalculate centroids based on the mean of points in each cluster.
    - Repeat: Continue the assignment and update steps until centroids stabilize or a stopping criterion is met.

Advantages:
- Simple and Efficient: Easy to understand and implement.
- Scalable: Works well with large datasets.
- Versatile: Can be used for various types of data and applications.

Elbow Method: A technique to determine the optimal number of clusters by plotting the within-cluster sum of squares against different K values.
