Random Forest is an ensemble learning method used for classification and regression tasks. 
It builds multiple decision trees and merges them to get a more accurate and stable prediction.

Key Concepts:
- Ensemble Learning: Combines the predictions from multiple models to improve the overall performance compared to individual models.
- Decision Trees: Random Forest is built on top of decision trees. Each tree in the forest is constructed using a random subset of the data.
- Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating): Involves creating multiple subsets of the original data with replacement (bootstrapping) and building a decision tree on each subset. 
The results are aggregated (averaged or voted) to produce the final prediction.
- Feature Randomness: During the construction of each tree, a random subset of features is considered for splitting at each node. 
This randomness helps create trees that are different from each other, reducing correlation among them and leading to better generalization.

Advantages:
- High Accuracy: By averaging the results of multiple trees, Random Forest often achieves high accuracy.
- Robust to Overfitting: Although individual trees may overfit, the ensemble model mitigates this by averaging their predictions.
- Feature Importance: Random Forest provides estimates of feature importance, which can be useful for understanding the data.

Disadvantages:
- Computationally Intensive: Building and combining multiple trees can be resource-intensive.
- Interpretability: The model is less interpretable compared to a single decision tree due to the complexity of having many trees.
